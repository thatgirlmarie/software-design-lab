Software Project Proposal

3/26/2019

### 1. Description
    A simple student-facing website with clear and concise information on scholarships for new and continuing students at The City College of New York. The website exists for students and for the public (so possible for prospective students as well). I envision a modern and clean look, with lighter colors than the current City College website, something that is more inviting and says "We know what we are doing" instead of giving off the message of disorganization. This is one the biggest complaints we receive from our students (finding information and offices being disorganized) so the opportunity to create something good from the start, is significant.

### 2. Requirements
    Pages on the website: Main Page, Available Scholarships & Eligiblity, Scholarship Application Deadlines (include link to scholarship application), Scholarships FAQ, Submit a Question/Contact Page

### 3. About The Organization/Requestor
    The City College of New York has no independent scholarship office and instead processes scholarships via the Admissions Office - there is no public facing website that gives students detailed information about scholarships and the CCNY website is often deemed difficult to navigate. The current informational page for Scholarships is dense and requires a lot of scrolling to find important information that is most frequently sought after. An overhaul is urgently needed to get the most important and relevant information. With a design team, we can hopefully avoid some of the flaws in the current website, due to staff being in charge of the design and content management.

    As a recent transfer to the scholarship office (with a lot of institutional knowledge as both an employee and alumnus) and as someone learning the scholarship process, I am uniquely qualify to outline what our 'office' needs to convey to students and what kind of information students are seeking out. I interact internally with the processing team, across campus with the schools and divisions submitting scholarship disbursements and advising students, as well as students who have questions, concerns, and have given detailed feedback. These interactions plus my own experience as a student, and my newness to the office, mean we have a real opportunity to make these improvements. The scholarships process and admissions office are going through a transition and it would be terrible to let this crisis of confidence go to waste when we can use it to improve our service to students.
