# $NAME's Technical Journal

## Week Two (1/30 to 2/6)

This week, I spent the majority of my time going through the additional resources listed in the syllabus, practicing the commands we had learned in class, and googling random topics that I didn't know. I spent the majority of my time with the Command Line Crash Course from Learn Python the Hard Way and found it wasn't completely intuitive which forced me to look up a lot on my own - which ended up not being a bad thing, because I enjoy learning more sometimes when it is something I seek out and want to know.

Hour 1: DHRI Command Line tutorial from syllabus
Hour 2: Command Line Crash Course
Hour 3: Command Line Crash Course
Hour 4: Opening/navigating files on my machine, using the command line
Hour 5: 
Hour 6: 
Hour 7: 

## Week Three (2/7 to 2/13)

This week, I focused on getting comfortable using a text editor and read about/practiced markdown and reading about the benefits of plain text editing. I already had Anaconda installed, so I checked for any updates. I edited this file and my goals file and had to figure out how to replicate what we did in class, to get them fully committed to github

Hour 1: Edited goals & journal documents, could not figure out why commit was giving me an error. Closed terminal 3 times. Got frustrated. Watched some instagram stories. Came back, checked notes, figured out I needed to add my commit message. Successfully edited the files, pushed, and commited them.
Hour 2: Attempt to do this again to replicate the process and write down exact successful steps. Somehow created new file in repo .DS_Store - no idea what this is. Too afraid to touch it.
