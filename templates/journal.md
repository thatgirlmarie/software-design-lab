# $NAME's Technical Journal

## Week Two (1/30 to 2/6)

This week, I spent the majority of my time going through the additional resources listed in the syllabus, practicing the commands we had learned in class, and googling random topics that I didn't know. I spent the majority of my time with the Command Line Crash Course from Learn Python the Hard Way and found it wasn't completely intuitive which forced me to look up a lot on my own - which ended up not being a bad thing, because I enjoy learning more sometimes when it is something I seek out and want to know.

Hour 1: DHRI Command Line tutorial from syllabus
Hour 2: Command Line Crash Course
Hour 3: Command Line Crash Course
Hour 4: Opening/navigating files on my machine, using the command line

## Week Three (2/7 to 2/13)

This week, I focused on getting comfortable using a text editor and read about/practiced markdown and reading about the benefits of plain text editing. I already had Anaconda installed, so I checked for any updates.
