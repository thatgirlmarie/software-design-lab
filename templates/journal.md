# $NAME's Technical Journal

## Week Two (1/30 to 2/6)

This week, I spent the majority of my time going through the additional resources listed in the syllabus, practicing the commands we had learned in class, and googling random topics that I didn't know. I spent the majority of my time with the Command Line Crash Course from Learn Python the Hard Way and found it wasn't completely intuitive which forced me to look up a lot on my own - which ended up not being a bad thing, because I enjoy learning more sometimes when it is something I seek out and want to know.

Hour 1: DHRI Command Line tutorial from syllabus
Hour 2: Command Line Crash Course
Hour 3: Command Line Crash Course
Hour 4: Opening/navigating files on my machine, using the command line
Hour 5: 
Hour 6: 
Hour 7: 

## Week Three (2/7 to 2/13)

This week, I focused on getting comfortable using a text editor and read about/practiced markdown and reading about the benefits of plain text editing. I already had Anaconda installed but somehow broke it, so I reinstalled. I edited this file and my goals file and had to figure out how to replicate what we did in class, to get them fully committed to github.

Hour 1: Edited goals & journal documents, could not figure out why commit was giving me an error. Closed terminal 3 times. Got frustrated. Watched some instagram stories. Came back, checked notes, figured out I needed to add my commit message. Successfully edited the files, pushed, and commited them.
Hour 2: Attempt to do this again to replicate the process and write down exact successful steps. Somehow created new file in repo .DS_Store - no idea what this is. Too afraid to touch it. SUCCESS in replicating and writing down actual steps used.
Hour 3: Began exercise 1 in Learn Python the Hard Way and ran into an issue with Python 2 vs 3. Spent time googling the error I got and discovered it's a 2 vs 3 issue. Which should I run? Is it related to Anaconda version 2.7 vs 3.7? Q: how do I fix it. To be continued...for now I'll add the parentheses and run it how it's meant to run in 3. Confirmed 2.7 vs 3.7 issue.
Hour 4: Started going through Learning Python The Hard Way for Python 3

## Week Four (2/14 - 2/20)

Hour 1: Reviewing HTML coding basics on w3Schools website - played with creating basic sights and refreshing memory on tables in HTML (which are as awful as I remember)
Hour 2: I've never successfully used CSS before so started going through the CSS page on w3schools and made it through the intro, syntax, how-to, and made some attempts on my play HTML page - I definitely need to spend more time on this - I slacked off this week

## Week Five (2/21 - 2/27)

This week I spent time on the readings and made more attempts with HTML & CSS. I tentatively googled one of the tasks I'd like to be able to do in Python this semester - adding a batch word or portion to a file name. Have decided to get together with a classmate if we can coordinate it, to practice together and hopefully get in some peer learning - I often learn better when helping someone else or if someone is looking to me with an expectation

Hour 1: Installed Jekyll - easier than anticipated, just followed instructions and read terminal output; googled "write python program to rename files" and got a Stack Overflow page to read through...
Hour 2: Attempting to make it through Learn Python the Hard Way...

## Week Six (2/28 - 3/5)

Hour 1-3: Had Chris from class over and we worked through a few lessons in Learn Python the Hard Way, helped him with his command line setup (my husband expert helped with software installation and configuring something for windows...)

## Week Seven (3/6 - 3/12)

Hour 1: Attempted to work with some of the information in the Programing Paradigms reading and promptly gave up - still struggling to wrap my head around this, though our class time helped a bit
Hour 2: Shamefully slacked...

## Week Eight (3/14 - 3/20)

Hour 1: After our class where we went through my issue of wanting to figure out how to rename files, did some research into these concepts. Felt overwhelmed so did not attempt to tackle a renaming, but went down a github rabbit hole of other peoples repositories.
Hour 2-3: More Learn Python The Hard Way - he says to break your code and go back and fix this but I am finding that to be difficult for me. Not because I never break my code, but because when I am following along, I don't particularly struggle, especially when following along with a textbook; however I am not inclined to attempt to code random things without context (harkening back to my challenge of pulling ideas for projects out of thin air & thinking computationally)so I am barely "creating" anything outside of this. It's my main struggle here and it is leaving me stuck.
Hour 4-5: Dealing with some delightful seasonal illness this week so put the book away.

## Week Nine ( 3/21 - 3/27)

Hour 1:
